Rule:
Rules are the sets of properties you are applying to a selector.
For instance we have a div with the id of "container"
#container{ <--- Selector
    height: 300px;
    display: inline-block:
    width: 400px;
}
The height, display, and width are the rules for that selector, or its rule set.

Property and value:
Properties are the css styles you are applying to the rule.
#container{
    width: 500px;
}
The property in this case is the width and we set it at a value of 500 pixels.
