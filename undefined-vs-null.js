// Null is user defined where as undefined is trying to reach a variable that doesn't have a value.

// A good example of null would be in a database of a persons middle name. Some people want to enter that data, some don't.
// So if they do not want to enter that data, it will just remain null. When reading from the database, we can just simply ignore it.
let y = null;

console.log(y);

// Undeclared - doesn't exist.
console.log(variable);
